                  The Supermarine S.4 was a 1920s British single-engined
                  monoplane built by Supermarine. Designed by a team led by the
                  company's chief designer, R. J. Mitchell, it was built to race
                  in the 1925 Schneider Trophy contest. Mitchell's design was
                  revolutionary. Aware of the need to reduce drag forces to
                  increase speed, he produced a floatplane that was in marked
                  contrast to the flying boats previously designed by
                  Supermarine. Built of wood, and with an unbraced cantilever
                  wing, it was powered by a Napier Lion engine developed to
                  produce 700 horsepower (520 kW) over a short racing period.
                  The S.4 was aerodynamic and aesthetically pleasing, but the
                  cockpit position was potentially hazardous, as it restricted
                  the pilot's view. Less than a month after its maiden flight on
                  24 August 1925, it raised the world's seaplane speed record to
                  226.752 miles per hour (364.922 km/h). At Bay Shore Park in
                  Baltimore in the US, the venue of the 1925 contest, the S.4's
                  rear end was damaged by a falling pole during a gale prior to
                  the event. During navigation trials on 23 October, the
                  repaired aircraft was observed to be performing well, but
                  then—for reasons that have not been fully explained—it went
                  out of control, and was destroyed when it dived into the sea
                  from 100 feet (30 m), injuring the pilot, Henri Biard [it].
                  Mitchell used the practical experience gained from his work on
                  the S.4 when designing its immediate successor, the
                  Supermarine S.5.
